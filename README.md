# Batch Analysis of Stop-signal Task Data (BASTD)
BASTD is a package with a series of functions used to analyze and visualize stop-signal task (SST) data such as that generated by [OSARI](https://github.com/teamOSTAP/OSARI).

## About
BASTD was created to comprehensively batch analyse data from standard stop-signal paradigms. It was primarily developed to analyse data from OSTAP's [OSARI](https://github.com/teamOSTAP/OSARI), though it can be adapted to analyse data from other stop-signal paradigms. If you need help with implementing BASTD, please email the team at: opensourceTAP@gmail.com

## Getting Started
The functions of BASTD can be separated into those which analyze and those which visualize.

## Analyze function
The functions used to analyze data is:
  * `BASTD_analyze()`
  
### BASTD_analyze
BASTD expects recorded stop-signal data as a txt input with the column headers: ID, Block, Trial, Stimulus, Signal, Response, Correct, RT, RE, SSD, TrialType. Although originally generated for [OSARI](https://github.com/teamOSTAP/OSARI), it can be used with data output from any stop-signal task so long as data are formated in this way (data output from OSARI is formatted using `OSARI_analyze`).

  * `ID`: Any Character or String
  * `Trial`: Numeric values in increasing order and reset after every block
  * `Stimulus`: 1 or 2 (for choice-reaction variants of the SST)
  * `Signal`: 0 or 1 (0 meaning no signal was presenented, i.e., a Go-trial, and 1 meaning a signal was presented i.e., a Stop-trial)
  * `Response`: 0 or 1 (0 for no response, 1 for a response)
  * `Correct`: 0 or 2 (0 for incorrect, 2 for correct) 
  * `RT`: A numerical value for RT in ms (e.g., 300 ms)
  * `RE`: *Not currently implemented*
  * `SSD`: A numerical value for Stop-signal delay in ms (e.g., 250 ms)
  * `TrialType (Optional)`: *only relevant for data from OSARI*

Provided the column names are consistent with the above, BASTD_analyze should be able to analyze any dataset from a SST. 

### OSARI_convert
Converts data from OSARI to be compatible with BASTD_analyze. Returns converted data. See `example-data` for file structure.

### STOPIT_convert
Converts data from STOP-IT to be compatible with BASTD_analyze. Returns converted data. See `example-data` for file structure.

## Visualize functions
The function used to visualize data is: 
  * `BASTD_visualize()`

### A note on *Context Independence* violations
When analysing the data from Anticipatory Response Inhibition (ARI) stop-signal tasks such as OSARI, we recommend users be aware of [recent updates in the modelling literature](https://psyarxiv.com/9h3v7/), in particular the relevance of Context Independance. If you have reason to suspect a violation of Context Independance in your data/selected paradigm, we recommend using the [Dynamic Models of Choice (DMC) R system](osf.io/tw46u/). Please see the manuscript for further information.
